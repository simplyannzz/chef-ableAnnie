# Chef-ableAnnie

## Description

Chef-able is a team project that involved Annie Bui, Isabella Kington, Thomas Gonquoi, and Nicholas Wachira. The idea behind Chef-able was: we want to build an app for the everyday chef that wants to cook, like Michelin chef that doesnt have enough time in the day to cook, find recipes, go shopping, and prep into one website.

Overview of the sections:
The main page has navbar, hero image with a fortune cook that gives a qoute of the day. The shopping section, the user can input their grocery list with the weight of the food products. Recipes has the recipe that the users can create on their own or search the recipes using the API. The planner sections help plan the meal for breakfest, lunch, and dinner for the the week. And lastly, the about is getting to know the users' information such as name, age, gender, country, and allgeries they might have.

## Installation

I used the tools that I had on my computer, like Git, Vscode, Github, and Google. First, I cloned the repo into my local file, made a GitHub repo, and named both the local and global repo. I opened the file in my VScode and started coding the project, and used Chrome developer tools to live to check the website for errors and stuff. Then I push it into my GitHub for deployment.
